# TidyTuesday
Exploring Tidy Tuesday datasets in R
# A weekly social data project in R
A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.
# Personal Goals
Currently, my goal is to create 2 charts a week analyzing the weekly dataset.
